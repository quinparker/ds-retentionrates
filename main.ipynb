    "The most important features that contribute to the retention rate, according to this one run of a random forest regression, are as follows:\n",

    "* **HRCHG3** - Out-of-state per credit hour charge for part-time undergraduates\n",
    "* **LEVEL3** - Whether the institution offers an associate's degree\n",
    "* **C15UGPRF** - The Carnegie Undergraduate Profile Classification\n",
    "* **ANYAIDP** - Percent of full-time first-time undergraduates awarded any financial aid\n",
    "* **EFDEEX5_3** - Students enrolled exclusively in distance education courses and location of student unknown/not reported; specifically those who are seeking degrees\n",
    "* **UPGRNTP** - Percent of undergraduate students awarded Pell grants. (Pell grants are for lower-income students.)\n",

    "\n",
    "* Nothing from the American Community Survey has appeared in the top ten, here.\n",
    "* The feature importances reported aren't terribly high. I don't know whether the low power is because\n",

    "* I also don't know enough about scikit-learn *yet* to be able to get *p*-values from these features, which would be a bit more useful. I'll do some research.\n",

    "appropriate algorithms, too. However, the main work of picking, loading and cleaning the data is done.\n",
    "* As per the literature review, slicing these into college types (private, public / 2-year, 4-year) yielded some more useful results. This is borne out by some of the features that appeared as the most important -- degree type, student type. Can we filter down and get some specific recommendations?\n",
    "* Some colleges are at 0% first-year retention, and some others are at 100%. Why? Will removing these make the model more reliable, or not?\n",
    "* Should we ditch using the ACS entirely? I noticed it didn't contain all of the counties. Should we use 5-year data instead?\n",
